pvdb
================================

.. warning:: **This is still a work in progress, and documentation is only a placeholder shell as of now. Will update once the code is working.**



pvdb stands for "python veg database" and is a python wrapper for the `NVDB Rest API <https://www.vegvesen.no/nvdb/apidokumentasjon/>`_


Data pulled from the API is licensed under
Norsk lisens for offentlige data `NLOD <http://data.norge.no/nlod/no/1.0>`_

Currently working on a initial prototype in the "Dev" branch.
Will push to master once I have something that sortof works.
